Answer to Exercise 5

Exercise 7 - Difficulty Level: Intermediate

Write a program to work out if a series of 5 digits are consecutive numbers. To make this easier, assumes the digits are a string:

string numbers = "10-9-8-7-6";

Make sure your code works for the following sequence, as well:

string numbers = "1-2-3-4-5";

The two string variables above are from C# .NET. In VB NET, the variable declarations would be:

Dim numbers As String = "10-9-8-7-6"

Dim numbers As String = "1-2-3-4-5"

In Java they would be:

String numbers = "10-9-8-7-6";

String numbers = "1-2-3-4-5";

Following on from the exercise above, work out if a series of 5 integers contain the same number. So the sequence 10-9-8-7-7 would yield the answer "Pair of numbers found".
