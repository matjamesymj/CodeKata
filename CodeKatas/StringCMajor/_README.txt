Dim notes As String = "ABCDEFG"

Use string methods to extract the key of C Major (CDEFGAB) from the variable called notes. Display your answer in a textbox or a listbox for VB NET and C#. For Java, you can output to a console window. When you have finished this exercise, you should have the following displayed:

The key of C is: CDEFGAB
