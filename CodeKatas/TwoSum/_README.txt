Write a function that, given a list and a target sum, returns zero-based indices of any two distinct elements whose sum is equal to the target sum. 
If there are no such elements, the function should return null.

For example, FindTwoSum(new List<int>() { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }, 12) should return any of the following tuples of indices:

1, 4 (3 + 9 = 12)
2, 3 (5 + 7 = 12)
3, 2 (7 + 5 = 12)
4, 1 (9 + 3 = 12)
